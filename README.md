## PROJECT STILL IN PROGRESS

## Inspiration
I have been a gym rat all my life. When I was a student I had found it easy to spend long hours working out in the gym. But after I got my first job, I quickly came to realise that such a lifestyle was not balanceable with the 9-5 grind. I had also realised that this is a common faced by many others. This inspired me to find a solution that will :-
A) Provide a quick workout routine for the average 9-5 worker.
B) Easy to generate, with minimal input needed from the user.
C) Was free and accessible to anyone.

And thus, FitMix was born.


## What it does
In short, it's a **workout generation webapp**.

In long, the app generates workouts in the [PPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_weight_training#Push/Pull/Legs) split workout routine where the user will input what part of the split they want a workout routine for and for how long they plan to workout. The app will then generate a custom workout routine where the user recieves 3 unique strength based exercises to complete for each hour they plan to workout.

## How I built it
The core logic of the app was designed by me using a unique algorithm I had developed for ranking exercises. The techstack I used was React with Typescript and components used from the React-Bootstrap Library. I had developed the app using the **WebStorm IDE by JetBrains**.


## What I learned
Through the development of this app, I had not only learned how to develop the UI for the webapp and how exactly it all ties in with my core logic, but also the design and implementation of my exercise ranking algorithm itself

## What's next for FitMix
Next I will be focusing on improving the workout logic and the UI. Some key area's I will be focusing on are:-
1) Implementing more workout routines and types other than PPL.
2) Adding features to edit the workouts generated such as adding or subtracting hours spent working out within the display page, increasing or decreasing the number of sets and reps per exercise, etc.
3) Adding a login and profile system to track your progress and save the workouts you generate for yourself.
4) Developing a cross platform mobile app for generating workouts on the go.

And much more!
